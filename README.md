# Wake-up

This project is a service that detects and awakens sleepiness in an online learning environment.
I checked the user's status using opencv.
Using the Google Teachable Machine, the AI model was divided into two classes: sleepiness and steady state.
It detects sleepiness and wakes you up with sound.
After that, I send a message using KakaoTalk rest API and the message contains a link to YouTube music.

It's a great honor to finish this project. 
If there is a problem or improvement, please register it as an issue.
