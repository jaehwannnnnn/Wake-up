# Wake-up

The purpose of this project is to detect sleepiness during online classes and give notifications. 
It is a function that makes a noise and transmits a Kakao Talk message when a user detects sleepiness. 
I checked the user's status using OpenCV.
Using the Google Teachable Machine, the AI model was divided into two classes: sleepiness and steady state.
It detects sleepiness and wakes you up with sound.
After that, I send a message using KakaoTalk rest API and the message contains a link to YouTube music.

If there is a problem or improvement, please register it as an issue.
